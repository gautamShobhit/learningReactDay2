-->Hey there!! Today we have learnt the core basics how does a create react app actually works in the background and talked about the unsung warrior 🗿 "THE PARCEL"

-->We learnt about how npm works and what does it actually do and also covered the very minute details of dependencies, .json files and it's offsprings -> (.parcel-cache and dist)

-->"Files which can be re-generated are never push to git..." Following this quote we also mentioned these files in .gitignore since server recreates these files using .json file

-->Power of npm: We installed React as a module and imported it to our script file, No need to copy paste those lengthy cdn links 😁. It makes it even faster.

We'll continue coding and learning stuff until we get enough of it... And I guess we'll never get enough of it cuz tech is ever evolving.....🚀🚀
